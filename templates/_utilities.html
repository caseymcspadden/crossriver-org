<p>Cross River Software got its start in 1997 developing software for water utilities. Working closely with the Metropolitan Water District of Southern California--the largest supplier of treated water in the United States--and its member agencies, we have developed tools to forecast water demand, to evaluate the effectiveness of water conservation programs, to <a href="{{docroot}}/projects/netshare">analyze water distribution networks</a> and to assist in various water resource planning efforts. One of our signature products is <a href="{{docroot}}/projects/irpsim">IRPSIM</a>, an Integrated Resources Planning software application that Metropolitan has been using for over fifteen years to run its primary water resource planning and sales forecasting models. </p>
