<p>With the small size and assortment of features such as cameras, GPS and motion detection in today's smart devices, we're excited about the potential of mobile apps to both meet the needs of our existing utility and energy clients and to allow us expand our business into new areas. For example, we've been working with a non-profit firm in the Pacific Northwest to develop a mobile app that allows users to report whale and other marine mammal sightings. We have demonstrated a prototype of the application to an enthusiastic audience at NOAA's Regional Headquarters in Seattle and are in the process of securing funding for further development. We have expertise in both iOS and Android operating systems.</p>
