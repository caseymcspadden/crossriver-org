<p>Cross River entered the renewable energy field when we were approached by a major wind energy services company in Seattle for help in managing weather data they were collecting from hundreds of sites they monitored for wind farm developers, utilities and government agencies around the world. We developed an enterprise-level database and software tools to assist their data analysis staff in performing customized data quality control and data validation and to support the activities of logistics staff who are responsible for installing and maintaining meteorological equipment. We are currently pursuing projects with other renewable energy clients.</p>
