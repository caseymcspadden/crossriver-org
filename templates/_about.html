We specialize in devising elegant solutions to challenging problems that are not easily solved with out-of-the-box software. Company founder Casey McSpadden works with partners in the fields of policy analysis, geographic information systems, database development and graphic design to create software that is both analytically powerful and easy to use. Historically, the majority of our clients have been utilities and renewable energy companies, but we've worked with clients in fields ranging from financial services to archaeology to nanotechnology.
