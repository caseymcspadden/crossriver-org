<p>This demo shows the relative positions of the Sun and the nine solar system planets (including Pluto!) along with plots of their orbits.</p>
<p>The demo defaults to the current date. Select a different date in the text box, or animate the display using the play (<span class="ui-icon ui-icon-play CRControlIcon" title="play"></span>) button. Use the rewind (<span class="ui-icon ui-icon-seek-first CRControlIcon" title="rewind"></span>) button to return to the current date and the reset (<span class="ui-icon ui-icon-refresh CRControlIcon" title="reset"></span>) button to return to the default orientation.</p>
<p>Click and drag your mouse to change the orientation of the display, and use the zoom control to get a better view of the inner planets.</p>
<p>Use the settings dialog to choose the frame of reference for the display. The display defaults to Sun-centric. Change the center to "Earth" and animate to to see the retrograde motions of the planets and their changing distance from Earth over time.</p>
