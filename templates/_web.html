<p>We have been building websites and web applications for our clients since the early days of the internet. While we're proficient at adapting modern content management systems such as WordPress and Drupal (often, this is the best approach) we specialize in developing custom solutions to meet our clients' unique needs. For example, we built a special-purpose web-based "wizard" to guide an applicant in filling out a complicated Russia visa application form and an online system for scheduling events that is being used internally by financial planning firms to book client meetings. We like to leverage small-footprint frameworks such as Slim, jQuery and Backbone and open-source databases like MySQL to build data-intensive web applications that are intuitive, fast and lean.</p>
